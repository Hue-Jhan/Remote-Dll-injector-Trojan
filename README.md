This malware injects a malicious library into a target process or directly creates a process and uploads the library into it, the dll contains a simple encoded base64 data that spawns a reverse shell.

Both coes are undetected by Windows defender, but the local injection is detected by 10 antiviruses. Using a simple certificate and metadata manager like Process Hacker (free an open source) i uploaded the data of a common app (in my case it was github desktop setup) and the AVs went from 10 to 1 in an instant, and for the first time Bitdefender didn't flag it as suspicious ðŸ˜€!!! The file went from a few kilobytes to like 100mb tho so i think i'll have to work on that, maybe by embedding only the essential metadata and certificates.
