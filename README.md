The local injection is detected by 10 antiviruses, but using a simple certificate and metadata manager like Process Hacker (free an open source) i uploaded the data of a common app (in my case it was github desktop) and the AVs went from 10 to 1 in an instant, and for the first time Bitdefender didn't flag it as suspicious ðŸ˜€
